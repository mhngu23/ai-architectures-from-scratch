# ai-architectures-from-scratch

A personal collection of core deep learning architectures reimplemented from scratch for study and mastery.  
Includes Transformers, CNNs, RNNs, Autoencoders, GANs, and Diffusion models.

## üìö Purpose

This repository is dedicated to building fundamental deep learning architectures from scratch using minimal libraries (primarily NumPy), to deeply understand their inner workings.

## üß≠ Roadmap

Each week is based on a 4-hour time budget.

| Week | Topic                          | Goal |
|------|--------------------------------|------|
| 1    | Project Setup + Core Utils     | Set up repo, implement `Linear`, `ReLU`, and `MSE` from scratch |
| 2    | Optimizers & Training Loop     | Add SGD/Adam, build basic training loop |
| 3-4  | Transformer (Part 1)           | Implement Scaled Dot-Product Attention, Multi-Head Attention |
| 5-6  | Transformer (Part 2)           | Complete encoder-decoder model, run toy training |
| 7-8  | Diffusion Model (Forward)      | Build forward noising process, visualize steps |
| 9-10 | Diffusion Model (Reverse)      | Train denoiser, reconstruct images |
| 11   | CNNs                           | Implement and train simple CNN for image classification |
| 12   | RNN / LSTM / GRU               | Build and test sequence models on toy tasks |
| 13+  | Autoencoders, GANs, ViT, etc.  | Expand to unsupervised and generative models |
